Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a significant trend within the technologically advanced industrial sector. The influence of ML techniques can be seen across various fields, including the medical, industrial, and security sectors. Initially, the dataset was cleaned and then divided into a validation dataset. Various approaches, including the use of imbalanced and balanced datasets, were implemented. The use of random forest classifier with parameters n\_estimators= n 100 resulted gave the best classifier.
